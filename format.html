                    <p>Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf
                        in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her
                        song—knowledge of the people who constructed the
                        monument and the mythic saga it depicts.</p>
                    <p>A stern human warrior bangs his sword rhythmically against his scale mail, setting the tempo for
                        his war chant and exhorting his companions to bravery and heroism. The magic of his song
                        fortifies and emboldens them.</p>
                    <p>Laughing as she tunes her cittern, a gnome weaves her subtle magic over the assembled nobles,
                        ensuring that her companions' words will be well received.</p>
                    <p>Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire
                        allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.</p>

                    <h5>Music and Magic</h5>
                    <p>In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with
                        power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say
                        that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that
                        the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still
                        resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those
                        echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>

                    <p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the
                        sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a
                        distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves
                        in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean
                        toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging
                        knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude
                        that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds
                        to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.</p>

                    <h5>Learning from Experience</h5>
                    <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester
                        cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study
                        and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours
                        and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true
                        bards, though. A bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories,
                        and living on the gratitude of audiences, much
                        like any other entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of
                        magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>

                    <p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new
                        tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring
                        career a natural calling. Every adventure is
                        an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost
                        works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures.
                        Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their
                        deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns
                        renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing
                        mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and
                        assume heroic roles themselves.</p>
                    <i>“Music is the fruit of the divine tree that vibrates with the Words of Creation. But the question
                        I ask you is, can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the source of that power?
                        Ah, then what manner of music they would bring to this world!”</i>
                    <p>— Fletcher Danairia, master bard</p>
