                    <p>Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in
                        objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their
                        spells and inventions. You can find everything you need
                        to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to
                        channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to
                        create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe
                        a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied
                        to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job
                        as well as an artificer.</p>

                    <h5>Artificers in Many Worlds</h5>
                    <p>Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war.
                        Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless
                        lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction
                        unleashed by certain artificers' creations.</p>

                    <p>In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of
                        Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the
                        Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk
                        to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep
                        airships and other wondrous devices operational.</p>

                    <p>Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there,
                        the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems
                        that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron,
                        magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of
                        the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.</p>
                    <p>Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic
                        as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane
                        power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist's supplies to
                        create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally's armor,
                        or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and
                        their talents.</p>

                    <h5>Arcane Science</h5>
                    <p>In the world of Eberron, arcane magic has been harnessed as a form of science and deployed
                        throughout society. Artificers reflect this development. Their knowledge of magical devices, and
                        their ability to infuse mundane items with magic, allows Eberron's most miraculous projects to
                        continue.</p>
                    <p>During the Last War, artificers were marshaled on a massive scale. Many lives were saved because
                        of the inventions of brave artificers, but countless lives were also lost because of the mass
                        destruction unleashed by their creations.</p>

                    <h5>Seekers of New Lore</h5>
                    <p>Nothing excites an artificer quite like uncovering a new metal or discovering a source of
                        elemental energy. In artificer circles, new inventions and strange discoveries create the most
                        excitement. Artificers who wish to make their mark must innovate, creating something fresh,
                        rather than iterating on familiar designs.</p>
                    <p>This drive for novelty pushes artificers to become adventurers. Eberron's main travel routes and
                        populated regions have long since been explored. Thus, artificers seek the frontiers of
                        civilization in hopes of making the next great discovery in arcane research.</p>
                    <i>“Artificers invent cutting-edge problems, then try to solve them-loudly and often with collateral
                        damage.”</i>

                    <p>At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this
                        ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny
                        nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical
                        properties of your choice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
                        </li>
                        <li>Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up
                            to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and
                            the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.</li>
                        <li>The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves,
                            chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.</li>
                        <li>A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a
                            picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as
                            you like.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the
                        property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you
                        use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property
                        at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is
                        equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your
                        maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new
                        property applies.</p>

                <div class="collapse show" id="feature3">
                    <p>You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result,
                        you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don't appear to be casting
                        spells in a conventional way; you look as if you're producing wonders
                        using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>

                    <h6><b>Tools Required</b></h6>
                    <p>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting
                        focus—specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool—in hand when you cast any
                        spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an
                        'M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.
                        See chapter 5, "Equipment," in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.</p>
                    <p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of
                        your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>

                    <h6><b>The Magic of Artifice</b></h6>
                    <p>As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting,
                        think about how you're using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds
                        using alchemist's supplies, you could be quickly producing a
                        salve. If you cast it using tinker's tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider
                        that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand
                        that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for
                        a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special. The same
                        principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don't study a spellbook
                        or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your
                        tools and create the specialized items you'll use to produce your effects. If you replace
                        cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal—perhaps
                        modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.
                        Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell's
                        effects. You don't have to justify how you're using tools to cast a spell. But describing
                        your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself
                        from other spellcasters.</p>

                    <h6><b>Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</b></h6>
                    <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher
                        levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips
                        Known column of the Artificer table.</p>
                    <p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know
                        with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>

                    <h6><b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b></h6>
                    <p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To
                        cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the
                        spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
                        you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from
                        the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your
                        Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down
                        (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level
                        spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four
                        spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
                        1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting
                        the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                    <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list
                        of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1
                        minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>

                    <h6><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h6>
                    <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of
                        the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your
                        Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting
