                        <p>Mystics are loners. Most discover the secrets of their power through vague references in tomes of lore or by ingratiating themselves to a master of the power.</p>
                        <p>In order to master their power, mystics must first master themselves. They spend months and years in quiet contemplation, exploring their minds and leaving nothing uncovered. During this time, they shun society and typically live
                            as hermits at the edge of society. A mystic who studied under a master worked as a virtual slave, toiling away at mundane tasks in return for the occasional lesson or cryptic insight.</p>
                        <p>When mystics finally master their power, they return to the world to broaden their horizons and practice their craft. Some mystics prefer to remain isolated, but those who become adventurers aren't content to remain on the fringe
                            of the world.</p>

                            <p>To add some texture to your mystic, consider the quirks your character has acquired. These behaviors have no game effect, but your character might become irritated or upset if forced to break them. They're a great roleplaying
                                tool to add character to the game. You can roll on or pick from the table below, or create your own quirks. Aim to create two quirks, to give them more of a chance to come into play. Finally, consider why your character
                                chose these behaviors. What do they say about your character's personality or background? Are they based on a specific incident or a belief?</p>

                    <p>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of this document. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.</p>

                        <p>A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table
                            shows the total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div><span data-title-index="9"> <span>Psionic Disciplines</span></span>
                        <p>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.</p>
                        <p>At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.</p>
                        <p>In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.</p>

                    <div><span data-title-index="10"> <span>Psi Points</span></span>
                        <p>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number
                            of psi points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</p>
                        <p>The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when
                            you finish a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.</p>

                    <div><span data-title-index="11"> <span>Psi Limit</span></span>
                        <p>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based
                            on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you
                            have.

                        <p>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline's
                            description. The benefit lasts until you are <a href="conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb" onmouseover="Renderer.hover.pHandleLinkMouseOver(event, this, 'conditionsdiseases.html', 'PHB', 'incapacitated_phb', null)" onmouseleave="Renderer.hover.handleLinkMouseLeave(event, this)"

                        <p>You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.</p>

                    <p>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects,
                        how many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</p>
                    <p>The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.</p>

                        <p>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.</p>

                    <div><span data-title-index="17"> <span>Effect Options and Psi Points</span></span>
                        <p>A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points
                            to use that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.</p>
                        <p>Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points
                            to increase a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can't decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</p>
                        <p>Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div><span data-title-index="18"> <span>Components</span></span>
                        <p>Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div><span data-title-index="19"> <span>Duration</span></span>
                        <p>An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.</p>
                        <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="20"> <span>Instantaneous.</span></span>
                            <p>If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.</p>
                            <div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div>
                        </div>

                            <p>Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with "conc." after the option's psi point cost. The "conc." notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration. For example,
                                if an option says "conc., 1 min.," you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute.</p>
                            <div class="rd__spc-inline-post"></div>
                            <p>Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time.
                                See <a href="book.html#PHB,10">chapter 10</a>, "Spellcasting," in the Player's Handbook for how concentration works.</p>

                        <p>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect, as presented in <a href="book.html#PHB,10">chapter 10</a>, "Spellcasting," of the Player's Handbook.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div><span data-title-index="23"> <span>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</span></span>
                        <p>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.</p>
                        <p>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div><span data-title-index="24"> <span>Combining Psionic Effects</span></span>
                        <p>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option
                            from a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect—applies while the durations
                            of the effects overlap.</p>
                        <p>Psionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule.</p>

                        <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your mind to read the psionic imprint left on an object. If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts
                            about it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>You also learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object's perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can't use other
                            senses.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to learn the object's location relative to you (its distance and direction) and to look at the object's surroundings
                            from its point of view as if you were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>
                        <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

                    <p>Beginning at 11th level, your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its normal limits. As an action, you gain 9 special psi points that you can spend only on disciplines that require an action or a bonus action
