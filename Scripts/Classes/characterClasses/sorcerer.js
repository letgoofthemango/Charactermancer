<p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in
    her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she
    takes to the air.</p>
<p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back.
    Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out
    from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p>
<p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of
    fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation
    with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned
    her skin bright blue.</p>
<p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some
    otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one
    learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary
    life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p>

<h5>Raw Magic</h5>
<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that
    waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused
    with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled
    magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce
    exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a
    sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear
    as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it
    to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's
    birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious
    spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to
    the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the
    inner workings of reality.</p>
<p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on,
    nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and
    channel their own inborn magic, they can discover
    new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>

<h5>Unexplained Powers</h5>
<p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the
    adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover
    that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's
    magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't
    called on.</p>
<p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a
    greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of
    its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it,
    or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an
    adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical
    knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the
    spells they know.</p>
<p>When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared
    to other characters. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to
    keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the
    role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively
    learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them.</p>
<p>Because the idea of an innately magical being traveling among them does not sit well with many
    folk, sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and suspicion in others they come across. Nonetheless,
    many sorcerers succeed in overcoming that prejudice
    through deeds that benefit their less magically gifted contemporaries.</p>
<p>Sorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those
    who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other
    sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their
    homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities.</p>

<div class="collapse show" id="feature1">
<p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.</p>

<h6><b>Cantrips</b></h6>
<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.</p>

<h6><b>Spell Slots</b></h6>
<p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>

<h6><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h6>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
<p>You learn an additional sorcerer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class,
you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

<h6><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h6>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p class="text-center"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
<p class="text-center"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>


<h6><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h6>
<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>

<h6><b>Spell Versatility</b></h6>
<p>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.</p>

ability to cheat death itself. This power comes at a cost. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be
unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can't bear to allow a fire to
sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a lit torch or sitting in front of a campfire.</p>
<p>More importantly, this gift comes with no special protection from fire. You are as vulnerable as any
other creature to fiery magic, including your own. Phoenix sorcerers can use their powers to pull
themselves back from the brink of death, and all too often their own, rash nature or reliance on
destructive magic is what puts them there in the first place.</p>
<p>Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous.
If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a
dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior,
confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.</p>

The hound uses the dire wolf's statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C in the Player's Handbook), with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</li>
<li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>
<li>It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
<li>At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast.

<p>Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
<p>Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.</p>

<p>Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.</p>
