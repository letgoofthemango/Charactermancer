<p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls
    down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p>
<p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the
    jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the
    cultists' activities.</p>
<p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers,
    sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p>
<p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world,
    druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over
    nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions
    of nature's indomitable will.</p>

<h5>Power of Nature</h5>
<p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the
    force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of
    transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to
    a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The
    ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of
    gods in temples and shrines.</p>

<p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon,
    of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a
    particular study of this practice, even to the
    point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p>

<h5>Preserve the Balance</h5>
<p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air,
    earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the
    others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one
    of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults
    of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.</p>
<p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal
    life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it.
    Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they
    hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and
    undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures,
    especially when the monsters encroach on the druids'
    territory.
</p>
<p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But
    when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids
    take on a more active role in combating the threat,
    as adventurers.</p>

<p>Druids are the caretakers of the natural world, and it is said that in time a druid becomes the
    voice of nature, speaking the truth that is too subtle for the general populace to hear. Many
    who become druids find that they naturally gravitate
    toward nature; its forces, cycles, and movements fill their minds and spirits with wonder and
    insight. Many sages and wise folk have studied nature, writing volumes about its mystery and
    power, but druids are a special kind of being: at
    some point, they begin to embody these natural forces, producing magical phenomena that link
    them to the spirit of nature and the flow of life. Because of their strange and mysterious
    power, druids are often revered, shunned, or considered
    dangerous by the people around them.</p>

<i>“Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an
    imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature. This is the destructive behavior
    of the mortal races. The farther away from nature their actions take them, the more corrupting
    their influence becomes. As druids, we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great
    Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and eradicate it.”</i>
<p>— Safhran, Arch druid</p>

        <p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>

        <h6><b>Cantrips</b></h6>
        <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>

        <h6><b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b></h6>
        <p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
            finish a long rest.</p>
        <p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells
            must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
        <p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level
            spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
        <p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>

        <h6><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h6>
        <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
            when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
        <p class="text-center"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
        <p class="text-center"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

        <h6><b>Ritual Casting</b></h6>
        <p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

        <h6><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h6>
        <p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells</p>

        <h6><b>Cantrip Versatility</b></h6>
        <p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid spell list.</p>
