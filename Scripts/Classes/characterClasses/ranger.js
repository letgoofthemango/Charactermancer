<p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he
    knows are
    planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of
    steel,
    cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
<p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the
    bird back
    to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and
    sends
    the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
<p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from
    the
    terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty
    plains,
    rangers keep their unending watch.</p>

<h5>Deadly Hunters</h5>
<p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of
    civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly
    dragons.
    They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and
    hiding
    themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are
    particularly
    useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
<p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that
    harness
    nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize
    speed,
    stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim
    task of
    protecting the borderlands.</p>

<h5>Independent Adventurers</h5>
<p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling
    is to
    defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press
    in from
    the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic
    circles. Many
    rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of
    orcs
    attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p>
<p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to
    life far
    from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and
    whine
    about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration,
    and
    compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a
    fight
    against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to
    feed
    themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>

<P>Rangers are free-minded wanderers and seekers who patrol the edges of civilized territory,
    turning back
    the denizens of the wild lands beyond. It is a thankless job, since their efforts are rarely
    understood
    and almost never rewarded. Yet rangers persist in their duties, never doubting that their work
    makes the
    world a safer place.</P>
<p>A relationship with civilization informs every ranger's personality and history. Some rangers see
    themselves as enforcers of the law and bringers of justice on civilization's frontier, answering
    to no
    sovereign power. Others are survivalists who eschew civilization altogether. They vanquish
    monsters to
    keep themselves safe while they live in and travel through the perilous wild areas of the world.
    If
    their efforts also benefit the kingdoms and other civilized realms that they avoid, so be it.
</p>

<i>“I spend a lot of my life away from civilization, keeping to its fringes to protect it. Don't
    assume that
    because I don't bend the knee to your king that I haven't done more to protect him than all his
    knights
    put together.”</i>
<p>— Soveliss</p>
