<p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an
    inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.</p>
<p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs
    arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe's fall.</p>
<p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours
    from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p>
<p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied
    as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary
    priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.</p>

<h5>Healers and Warriors</h5>
<p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world.
    Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant
    this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p>
<p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers
    and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive
    sense of a deity's wishes.</p>
<p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and
    hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down
    flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their
    combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p>

<h5>Divine Agents</h5>
<p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a
    simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not
    by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and
    involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p>

<p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it.
    Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization,
    smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs.
    Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting
    rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow
    a demon prince to enter the world.</p>
<p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their
    faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand
    it.</p>

<p>Almost all the folk in the world who revere a deity live their lives without ever being directly
    touched by a divine being. As such, they can never know what it feels like to be a
    cleric—someone who is not only a devout worshiper, but who
    has also been invested with a measure of a deity's power.</p>
<p>The question has long been debated: Does a mortal become a cleric as a consequence of deep
    devotion to one's deity, thereby attracting the god's favor? Or is it the deity who sees the
    potential in a person and calls that individual into service?
    Ultimately, perhaps, the answer doesn't matter. However clerics come into being, the world needs
    clerics as much as clerics and deities need each other.</p>
<p>If you're playing a cleric character, the following sections offer ways to add some detail to
    that character's history and personality.</p>

<i>“To become a cleric is to become a messenger of the gods. The power the divine offers is great,
    but it always comes with tremendous responsibility.”</i>
<p>— Riggby the patriarch</p>

    <div class="collapse show" id="feature1">
        <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.</p>


        <h6><b>Cantrips</b></h6>
        <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>

        <h6><b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b></h6>
        <p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
            a long rest.</p>
        <p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The
            spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
        <p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level
            spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
        <p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>

        <h6><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h6>
        <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom
            modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
        <p class="text-center"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
        <p class="text-center"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

        <h6><b>Ritual Casting</b></h6>
        <p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

        <h6><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h6>
        <p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>

        <h6><b>Cantrip Versatility</b></h6>
        <p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.</p>

            <p>Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility
                that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.</p>
            <p>The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include Azuth and Mystra, as well as Corellon Larethian of the elven pantheon. In other
                worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari of Krynn; and Boccob, Vecna, and WeeJas of Greyhawk.</p>

    <p>The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods
        of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate
        mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect
        them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</p>

        Forseti, and Asmodeus.</p>
    <p>The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an
        action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.</p>
    <p>Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability. In this manner, law creates an intricate web of obligations that allows society to forge order and security

    <p>War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and
        reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous,
        and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take
        a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p>
