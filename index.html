        <div class="collapse show" id="collapseIntro">
            <p>A human clad in simple robes walks along a forest path. A gang of goblins emerges from the brush, arrows trained on him, their smiles wide at their good fortune of finding such easy prey for the legion's slave pens. Their smiles turn to shrieks
                of terror as the traveler grows to giant size and leaps at them, his staff now a deadly cudgel.</p>
            <p>The militia forms in ranks to prepare for the orcs' charge. The growling brutes howl their battle cries and surge forward. To their surprise, the human rabble holds its ground and fights with surprising ferocity. Suddenly, mindless fear clings
                to the orcs' minds and they, despite facing a far inferior foe, turn and run, never noticing the calm half-elf standing amid the militia and directing its efforts.</p>
            <p>Baron von Ludwig was always proud of his grand library. Little did he know that each evening, a gnome laden with blank scrolls slipped past his guards each night and dutifully copied his most heavily guarded archives. When the duke's men arrived
                to arrest him for dealing with demons, he never guessed that the gnome scribe traveling with them had spent more time in his keep than he had over the past year.</p>
            <p>These heroes are all mystics, followers of a strange and mysterious form of power. Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world.
                Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of
                the physical world and bend it to their will.</p>

            <h5>Eccentric Minds</h5>
            <p>In order to maintain the strict discipline and intense self-knowledge needed to tap into their power, mystics develop a variety of practices to keep their focus sharp.</p>
            <p>These practices are reflected in taboos and quirks, strange little behaviors that govern a mystic's actions. These quirks are oaths or behavioral tics that help keep mystics in the proper frame of mind while maintaining perfect control over
                their minds and bodies.</p>
            <p>While these taboos are harmless, they help cast mystics as outsiders. Few feel accepted by society, and fewer still care to become integrated with it. To mystics, the life of the mind is where they feel most at home.</p>

            <div class="collapse show" id="feature1">
                <p>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of this document. Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from spellcasting.</p>

                <h6><b>Psionic Talents</b></h6>
                <p>A psionic talent is a minor psionic effect you have mastered. At 1st level, you know one psionic talent of your choice. You learn additional talents of your choice at higher levels. The Talents Known column of the Mystic table shows the
                    total number of talents you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new talent.</p>

                <h6><b>Psionic Disciplines</b></h6>
                <p>A psionic discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a mystic to manifest psionic power. A mystic masters only a few disciplines at a time.</p>
                <p>At 1st level, you know one psionic discipline of your choice. The Disciplines Known column of the Mystic table shows the total number of disciplines you know at each level; when that number goes up for you, choose a new discipline.</p>
                <p>In addition, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one discipline you know with a different one of your choice.</p>

                <h6><b>Psi Points</b></h6>
                <p>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know. This energy is represented by psi points. Each psionic discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of psi
                    points. A psionic talent requires no psi points.</p>
                <p>The number of psi points you have is based on your mystic level, as shown in the Psi Points column of the Mystic table. The number shown for your level is your psi point maximum. Your psi point total returns to its maximum when you finish
                    a long rest. The number of psi points you have can't go below 0 or over your maximum.</p>

                <h6><b>Psi Limit</b></h6>
                <p>Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the number of psi points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The limit is based on your
                    mystic level, as shown in the Psi Limit column of the Mystic table. For example, as a 3rd-level mystic, you can spend no more than 3 psi points on a discipline each time you use it, no matter how many psi points you have.
                </p>

                <h6><b>Psychic Focus</b></h6>
                <p>You can focus psionic energy on one of your psionic disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can choose one of your psionic disciplines and gain its psychic focus benefit, which is detailed in that discipline's
                    description. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit.</p>
                <p>You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.</p>

                <h6><b>Psionic Ability</b></h6>
                <p>Intelligence is your psionic ability for your psionic disciplines. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic discipline or when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p><b>Discipline save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p><b>Discipline attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

                <p>Psionic talents and disciplines are the heart of a mystic's craft. They are the mental exercises and psionic formulae used to forge will into tangible, magical effects.</p>
                <p>Psionic disciplines were each discovered by different orders and tend to reflect their creators' specialties. However, a mystic can learn any discipline regardless of its associated order.</p>

            <hr>

            <div class="collapse show" id="feature3">
                <p>Each psionic discipline has several ways you can use it, all contained in its description. The discipline specifies the type of action and number of psi points it requires. It also details whether you must concentrate on its effects, how
                    many targets it affects, what saving throws it requires, and so on.</p>
                <p>The following sections go into more detail on using a discipline. Psionic disciplines are magical and function similarly to spells.</p>

                <h6><b>Psychic Focus</b></h6>
                <p>The Psychic Focus section of a discipline describes the benefit you gain when you choose that discipline for your psychic focus.</p>

                <h6><b>Effect Options and Psi Points</b></h6>
                <p>A discipline provides different options for how to use it with your psi points. Each effect option has a name, and the psi point cost of that option appears in parentheses after its name. You must spend that number of psi points to use
                    that option, while abiding by your psi limit. If you don't have enough psi points left, or the cost is above your psi limit, you can't use the option.</p>
                <p>Some options show a range of psi points, rather than a specific cost. To use that option, you must spend a number of points within that point range, still abiding by your psi limit. Some options let you spend additional psi points to increase
                    a discipline's potency. Again, you must abide by your psi limit, and you must spend all the points when you first use the discipline; you can't decide to spend additional points once you see the discipline in action.</p>
                <p>Each option notes specific information about its effect, including any action required to use it and its range.</p>

                <h6><b>Components</b></h6>
                <p>Disciplines don't require the components that many spells require. Using a discipline requires no spoken words, gestures, or materials. The power of psionics comes from the mind.</p>

                <h6><b>Duration</b></h6>
                <p>An effect option in a discipline specifies how long its effect lasts.</p>
                <p> <b>Instantaneous.</b> If no duration is specified, the effect of the option is instantaneous.</p>
                <p> <b>Concentration.</b> Some options require concentration to maintain their effects. This requirement is noted with "conc." after the option's psi point cost. The "conc." notation is followed by the maximum duration of the concentration.
                    For example, if an option says "conc., 1 min.," you can concentrate on its effect for up to 1 minute. Concentrating on a discipline follows the same rules as concentrating on a spell. This rule means you can't concentrate on a spell
                    and a discipline at the same time, nor can you concentrate on two disciplines at the same time. See chapter 10, "Spellcasting," in the Player's Handbook for how concentration works.</p>

                <h6><b>Targets and Areas of Effect</b></h6>
                <p>Psionic disciplines use the same rules as spells for determining targets and areas of effect, as presented in chapter 10, "Spellcasting," of the Player's Handbook.</p>

                <h6><b>Saving Throws and Attack Rolls</b></h6>
                <p>If a discipline requires a saving throw, it specifies the type of save and the results of a successful or failed saving throw. The DC is determined by your psionic ability.</p>
                <p>Some disciplines require you to make an attack roll to determine whether the discipline's effect hits its target. The attack roll uses your psionic ability.</p>

                <h6><b>Combining Psionic Effects</b></h6>
                <p>The effects of different psionic disciplines add together while the durations of the disciplines overlap. Likewise, different options from a psionic discipline combine if they are active at the same time. However, a specific option from
                    a psionic discipline doesn't combine with itself if the option is used multiple times. Instead, the most potent effect—usually dependent on how many psi points were used to create the effect—applies while the durations of the effects
                    overlap.
                </p>
                <p>Psionics and spells are separate effects, and therefore their benefits and drawbacks overlap. A psionic effect that reproduces a spell is an exception to this rule.</p>
